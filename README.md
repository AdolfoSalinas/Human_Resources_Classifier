# Human_Resources_Classifier

Create a classifier using Human Resources data to determine which Employees are most likely to quit.
Compare outputs of Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Artificial Nural Network

Exploratory Data analysis 
Some of the highest correlated factors to attrition are Job Involvement (-13%), Stock Options level (-14%), total years working (-17%) and Distance from home(7%).

Initial ideas to combat attrition could include;

-More responsibility in independence in projects.

-Creating an open environment for discussion with morning team meetings. 

-Open stock options for new hires.

-Allow more remote work opportunities.

-Total years working may be created through the above mitigating actions.

In this case Random Forest produced the best results slightly edging out the logistic regression, the accuracy was higher, and the Type II errors were less. 
The ANN was the worst performer but would likely need more tuning of the parameters with a grid search to improve results.
